\# Reading Notes — CMPA 3301 Week 07



\## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Week 07 emphasizes \*\*project closeout\*\* as more than administrative wrap-up. The value lies in retrospectives and feedback, which convert a finished project into \*\*lasting knowledge\*\*. Closing well strengthens future work, while \*Range\* shows why breadth and experimentation matter for personal growth.



---



\## Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)

\- \*\*SLO-5:\*\* Describe the key components of a formal project closeout process.  

&nbsp; \*Plain:\* Know the checklist steps to make a project “done-done.”  

\- \*\*SLO-3:\*\* Explain the purpose and value of a retrospective.  

&nbsp; \*Plain:\* Reflection is the payoff — learning beats rushing.  

\- \*\*SLO-5:\*\* Provide constructive feedback to peers.  

&nbsp; \*Plain:\* Practice blameless, growth-focused reviewing.  

\- \*\*SLO-1:\*\* Synthesize concepts into personal/professional growth.  

&nbsp; \*Plain:\* Connect course lessons to your own development path.

\## Concept Synthesis



\### Closing the Project

\- Formal closeout includes: confirming scope, completing contracts, archiving docs, final reports, and sign-offs.  

\- The most important outcome: \*\*documenting lessons learned\*\*.  

\- Closing without reflection wastes the hard-earned experience.  



\### Retrospective

\- Guided by 3 questions: What went well? What went wrong? What will we do differently?  

\- Must be \*\*blameless\*\* — focus on improving process, not blaming people.  

\- Builds \*\*trust and psychological safety\*\*, which fuel team resilience.  



\### Range (Conclusion)

\- Growth is nonlinear; experimentation and detours expand “range.”  

\- Don’t compare yourself to others; compare to yesterday’s self.  

\- Failures are not wasted — they add to creative capacity and perspective.  



\### Peer Review \& Feedback

\- Giving and receiving feedback is integral to closing.  

\- Feedback is constructive, tied to criteria, and future-oriented.  

\- Reviewing others’ work reinforces your own learning.

\## Frameworks / Principles

\- \*\*Closing Checklist:\*\* Evaluate tasks → confirm scope → finalize procurement → document lessons → archive → publish → celebrate.  

\- \*\*Retrospective Rule:\*\* Always blameless, always forward-looking.  

\- \*\*Range Principle:\*\* Breadth + experimentation = stronger long-term capability.  

\- \*\*Feedback Loop:\*\* Constructive reviews create better teams and better personal practice.  



---



\## Applied Guidance

\- \*\*Discussion 07:\*\* Reflect on wins, struggles, and next steps. Tie to retrospective questions and Range.  

\- \*\*Assignment 04:\*\* Submit scope statement (Part 1) → provide peer reviews (Part 2). Focus on criteria-based, constructive comments.  

\- \*\*Future Practice:\*\* Archive documents as “gold.” Treat every project as an experiment with transferable lessons.

\## Quick Checks

\- Can I explain why a retrospective is crucial even after success?  

\- Do I know the 3 retrospective questions by heart?  

\- Can I outline closeout checklist steps from memory?  

\- Can I connect Range’s “breadth” idea to my own studies or work?  

\- Do I know what makes feedback constructive vs. empty praise?
