Question for you Alex, do you have a syllabus or outline for what you are teaching each class? I like to prepare a head of time with the materials.

Alex Deminchieli 8:36 PM
Yes, I can add it the program in Slack as soon as I have access to it. On a very high level we'll learn CSS, HTML and JavaScript

Hanna Jade Watson . 8:37 PM
@Alex Deminchieli would you mind going over the nav again? You can share a screenshot of your line of code for that If it‚Äôs easier. Also for the anchor tag for an image from a local file; I just need the code for that please üôÇ

You 8:37 PM (Edited)
