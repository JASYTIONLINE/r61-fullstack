# Module 1 – Software Engineering & SDLC – Study Log

## Summary  
This journal consolidates the lessons and transcripts from **Module 1 of Software Engineering**.  
It introduces software engineering as a discipline, traces its history and purpose, and expands in detail on the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, including its phases, responsibilities, and examples of real-world practice.

## Contents (SO WHATs)  

### Section 1: What Is Software Engineering  
- **SO WHAT:** Software engineering = application of scientific principles to design, create, and test software to meet business requirements.  
- **SO WHAT:** The “Software Crisis” (1960s–1980s) revealed that informal coding led to projects over budget, late, and unmanageable.  
- **SO WHAT:** The solution was consistent application of engineering principles and structured methodologies.  
- **SO WHAT:** Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools support analysis, debugging, validation, configuration, metrics, and project management.  
- **SO WHAT:** Software engineers take a broader, system-level approach than developers, focusing on scalability, architecture, and long-term maintenance.  
- **SO WHAT:** Responsibilities include designing, coding, testing, consulting with stakeholders, and maintaining systems.  
- **SO WHAT:** Modern practice is guided by the **SDLC**, which provides structure for building high-quality software.

### Section 2: Introduction to the SDLC  
- **SO WHAT:** The SDLC is a systematic process to develop high-quality software on time and within budget.  
- **SO WHAT:** The goal is to produce software that meets client business requirements.  
- **SO WHAT:** It originated in the 1960s as software complexity increased.  
- **SO WHAT:** Early SDLC used the **Waterfall model** (linear stages), later adapted to iterative methods to handle changing requirements.  
- **SO WHAT:** Advantages include efficiency, reduced risk, clearer responsibilities, and improved communication between teams and stakeholders.  
- **SO WHAT:** Each phase is discrete, providing structure and checkpoints for progress.

### Section 3: Phases of the SDLC (Expanded with Examples)  

#### [1] Planning  
- Gather, analyze, document, and prioritize requirements.  
- Consider users, purpose, inputs/outputs, compliance, risks, quality assurance, resources, and scheduling.  
- Example: A bank planning a new mobile app gathers input from customers, compliance officers, and IT staff; risks (like security breaches) are identified early.  
- Output: **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document.  

#### [2] Design  
- Transform requirements into system architecture and specifications.  
- Create diagrams, data models, and prototypes for stakeholder review.  
- Example: Designing an e-commerce platform may involve database schemas (for products and orders) and architecture diagrams for front-end, API, and backend services.  
- Output: **Design Document** with detailed technical specifications.  

#### [3] Development (Implementation)  
- Translate design into code using appropriate languages, frameworks, and standards.  
- Assign coding tasks, use version control (e.g., Git), and follow coding guidelines.  
- Example: Developers write the front-end in React, backend in Node.js, and connect it with an SQL database. Unit tests are written alongside features.  
- Output: A working build of the software system.  

#### [4] Testing  
- Validate software against requirements.  
- Include functional, non-functional, regression, and user acceptance testing.  
- Example: Test whether login authentication works, run load tests to see if 10,000 users can log in at once, regression tests confirm that fixing one bug didn’t break another.  
- Output: **Test Reports** documenting issues, fixes, and readiness.  

#### [5] Deployment  
- Deliver the software to users in production environments.  
- May involve beta releases, staged rollouts, or full deployment.  
- Example: A company releases its CRM tool first to internal teams, then gradually rolls it out to clients while monitoring for issues.  
- Output: **Live software** available to end-users.  

#### [6] Maintenance  
- Ongoing support, bug fixes, updates, and enhancements.  
- Respond to new requirements, adapt to updated platforms, patch security vulnerabilities.  
- Example: After launch, the banking app requires updates for new iOS/Android versions, regulatory compliance changes, and customer-requested features.  
- Output: **Updated software versions** and ongoing system stability.

## Overall Takeaways  
- Software engineering is not just coding: it is a discipline that applies systematic methods, roles, and tools to ensure successful software delivery.  
- The **Software Crisis** demonstrated the risks of unstructured development, leading to formal engineering practices.  
- The **SDLC** is the backbone of software engineering, providing structure and clarity through six distinct phases.  
- Each phase produces deliverables (SRS, design docs, test reports, deployments) that ensure quality and accountability.  
- Examples from banking apps, e-commerce, and enterprise software illustrate how each SDLC phase is applied in practice.  
- Mastery of the SDLC means being able to explain each phase, recognize deliverables, and see how teams interact across the cycle.
