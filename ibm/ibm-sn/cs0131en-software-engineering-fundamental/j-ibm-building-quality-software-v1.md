# software documentation – study log

## summary  
This journal reviews the **video: "Software Documentation"**.  
It explains what software documentation is, its different formats, and the distinction between product documentation and process documentation. It also introduces categories and types of documentation, including standard operating procedures (SOPs), and their role in guiding users and teams.

---

## learning objectives  
- List common documentation formats (written, video, interactive).  
- Compare product documentation to process documentation.  
- Describe categories and types of documentation.  
- Explain the purpose of standard operating procedures (SOPs).

## contents (so whats)  

### what is software documentation  
- **SO WHAT:** [Software documentation](#software-documentation) explains what the product is and how to use it.  
  Well-structured documentation—whether user manuals, developer guides, or [architecture diagrams](#architecture-diagram)—serves as the backbone of understanding.  

- **SO WHAT:** Documentation may be delivered as text, video, or interactive guides.  
  The formats of documentation can be as varied as the learning styles of its audience.  

- **SO WHAT:** It serves both end users (product manuals, guides) and developers (processes, [workflows](#workflow)).  
  Product documentation helps users navigate features and interfaces, while process documentation keeps the internal machinery humming smoothly.  

---

### importance of documentation  
- **SO WHAT:** Provides a clear and lasting record of how software works.  
  Documentation acts as a time-capsule, capturing design choices, rationale, and procedures that outlive team turnover.  

- **SO WHAT:** Reduces errors, accelerates onboarding, and improves collaboration.  
  Teams with solid documentation experience fewer misunderstandings and fewer [bugs](#bug).  

- **SO WHAT:** Ensures consistency across teams and supports compliance with organizational standards.  
  In regulated or fast-moving environments, documentation helps lock in a [single source of truth](#single-source-of-truth).  

---

### standard operating procedures (SOPs)  
- **SO WHAT:** [SOPs](#sop-standard-operating-procedure) describe standardized steps for recurring processes.  
  SOPs distill recurring workflows into repeatable, step-by-step instructions—removing guesswork.  

- **SO WHAT:** They promote reliability, safety, and repeatability.  
  Whether you're handling a critical deployment or a routine [code review](#code-review), SOPs help ensure each step is done right.  

- **SO WHAT:** SOPs help align technical work with business and operational goals.  
  By anchoring tasks to business context, SOPs ensure that routine actions are aligned with broader strategies.  

---

## overall takeaways  
- Software documentation is a critical support structure for both users and developers.  
- It ensures clarity, consistency, and efficiency in using and maintaining software systems.  
- SOPs are a specialized form of documentation that embed organizational knowledge into repeatable practices.
