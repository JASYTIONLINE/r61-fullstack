> The only thing more powerful than your idea is the logic you build behind it.

## 🎯 What Is JavaScript?

JavaScript is the **behavioral engine** of the modern web.

Where **HTML** puts content on the screen and **CSS** defines how it looks, **JavaScript makes it *do* things**. Without JavaScript, your website is a beautiful, non-interactive postcard. With JavaScript, it becomes a living, breathing application.

### 💡 Why JavaScript Exists

- Browsers needed a language to **react to user actions**  
- It runs **inside the browser** (client-side), and also on servers (Node.js)  
- It’s **dynamic**, **interpreted**, and **loosely typed**  
- JavaScript enables interactivity, custom logic, and user-driven behavior

## 🧠 How JavaScript Works

- Runs in the **browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)  
- Or runs server-side via **Node.js**  
- Reads your code **top-to-bottom** and executes it  
- Reacts to **events** (clicks, keypresses, etc.)  
- Has **automatic type coercion**, which can be powerful but also lead to surprising results

## 🧱 Why JavaScript Lives in Its Own Folder

This aligns with [**Separation of Concerns**](./separation-of-concerns.md).  
Each layer has its job:

- **HTML** = structure  
- **CSS** = style  
- **JavaScript** = behavior  

This folder is your logic layer — everything related to interaction, conditions, flow, and browser APIs.
