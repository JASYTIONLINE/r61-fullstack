# The Box Model

## The Wall is Box
Imagine a blank wall in your house. That wall is your web page. To organize it, picture the wall overlaid with invisible graph paper. No part of the wall is left unused — every square belongs to some box. The wall itself is the first, outermost box, and everything inside it is another box taking up space.  

Our hero does not like his wall so blank, so he is going to fill it up with pictures.  To POPULATE his wall, fill in the content of his webpage, he can only hang photos (elements) with in a frame (the box).  He wants to hang many different types of pictures (elements). Some are 5x7 (small boxes, 8x10s (medium box), and some a11x14 (bigger box). Some have fancy mats (padding) and Frames (borders), some are simple (minimal padding/border), and some are raw photos with no frame (no visible padding or border). 

*NOTE:* on the web, every box technically has a frame (border), but with CSS we can make that frame invisible. 

### [[1-soc|Separation of Concerns (SoC):]]

- Where a box goes is handled by [[html.basics|HTML]]. 
- What it looks like — spacing, sizing, borders, background — is handled by [[css.basics|CSS]].
- How it acts - what actions it performs is defined with Java.

*But, I digress. Back to the wall*

A web page is like a wall covered in graph paper. Every element is a box that claims a piece of that real estate. [[jasytionline.github.io/contents/20-portals/10-fs/modules/fs-2-front/html/h-basics|HTML]] decides *where* each box goes, while [[jasityonline/100-workshops/r61-fullstack/fs-2-front/css/c30-box|CSS]] decides *what it looks like*. Inside each box are four technical layers — [[#Content|Content]], [[#Padding|Padding]], [[#Border|Border]], and [[#Margin|Margin]] — which behave like the photo, mat, frame, and wall space in a picture-hanging analogy. Mastering these layers lets you predict layout, fix spacing problems, and design with confidence.
## Analysis
At the technical level, the browser renders each element as a rectangle with four nested regions. These regions control content flow, internal spacing, external spacing, and visible edges. Knowing which layer you’re adjusting solves most layout headaches:

Falling back to our picture analogy lets say we want to hang a photograph of Mom on the wall.
We need to define 4 characteristics of the picture in CSS:
- [[#Content|Content]] sets the payload and base dimensions.  The content size determines how much real estate (in  Pixels)  my mom.jp image takes up on the whole page.
- [[#Padding|Padding]] expands inside spacing without affecting neighbors.  - This defines how much room goes around mom's photo (in pixels) before the next box starts.
- [[#Border|Border]] defines visible edges (thickness of the frame around moms mom.jpg) and contributes (adds) to the total box size.  
- [[#Margin|Margin]] sets outside spacing between boxes (how much blank wall we see between mom and  dad's picture frames.)  
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; border: none;">
  <tr>
    <td style="border: none; padding-right:10px;">
      <img src="wall-2.png" alt="Mom and Dad frames" width="300"/>
    </td>
    <td style="border: none; padding-left:10px;">
      <img src="wall-3.png" alt="Box model labels" width="300"/>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>*Without this model, spacing looks random. With it, you can trace every pixel of layout back to one of the four layers. Each element defined in CSS has a real world analogy to help you visualize it.*

### Example: Your first box

#### style.css
```css
.card {
  background: #f8f9fa;
  border: 5px solid #333;
  padding: 15px;
  margin: 20px;
  width: 320px;
}
```
#### My-html-page.html
```
<div class="card">
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>Some text that lives in the card box.</p>
</div>

```
