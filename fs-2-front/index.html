<P>Riya Vedanta is a former elite PM, burnt out after a catastrophic failure known as GOATSTREAM. As the story unfolds, she is forced back into leadership and must rediscover her purpose — not by following The Plan, <br>
    but by becoming it. She was once a rising star in interstellar systems delivery. She was a certified master of procedural governance, fluent in PMBOK 6, and known for executing flawlessly within fixed scope, timeline, and budget.</P>
​
<h2> Then came <strong>Project GOATSTREAM</strong> — a well-documented disaster now used as a cautionary tale in PM onboarding.</h2>
​
<em>GOATSTREAM</em> was meant to deliver neural comfort loops to deep-space miners using ambient goat bleats. It followed every PMBOK 6 standard: triple-phase risk review, locked scope, stakeholder matrix, air-tight compliance, and <mark>it failed spectacularly.</mark><br>
​
During a routine transport mission: a solar flare disrupted the signal between the Miner Colony and the test goats.
The audio over-amplified. The goats panicked and started to stampede through the cargo hold.  It was not long before the goats workd them selves intot a frenzy and increased teh feedback loop to thee server.  Then the unthinkable happened - <strong>Then the goats exploded.</strong>
​
Riya could not understand what happened. She had followed the procuders to the letter:
<ol>1. She had done the Risk Analsyis</ol>
<ol>2. Logged the changes, and filled out the Gant Chart</ol>
<ol>3. The Gate had said GO. She had followed the book.</ol>
​
<P>But still it all went to hell.  The miners in Sector 9 reported weeks of auditory hallucinations. The only reason she wasn’t spaced was the amount of documentation she’d filed. She wasn’t officially fired. She was <em>buried</em> — reassigned to back-end monitoring, forgotten by leadership, and, over time, by herself.</P>
​
<p>When we meet her, she’s surviving on caffeine and apathy, quietly rotting in her own reputation. But the Plan — the real Plan — still flickers beneath the surface. She can feel it. She just doesn’t believe she deserves to touch it.</p>
